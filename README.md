These are pictures of my swerve drive that I made for FTC. It has a motor to turn the wheel and a servo to turn the entire module to direct the wheel. 
This allows for omnidirectional movement with full traction. It makes movement efficient and fast. The motor spins a central shaft which turns another gear which turns the main wheel.
This makes the mechansism actually move. The servo rotates a pulley up top which allows us to guide the swerve in any desired direction.
We are also currently developing code to go with this! I hope it's completed before school starts!
